## OpenCode-MAIT

**OpenCode-MAIT** is the Free and Open Source Software Community of MAIT. This community is being formed and taken forth with the joint support of CSE and IT 
Department of our college.

The volunteer-driven **OpenCode-MAIT** aims to spread awareness about the various open source softwares and the culture revolving around open source. The society 
aims 
to:-
1. Promote the use of Open Source software in our college.
2. Invite prominent speakers expert in their particular domain, to encourage students to pursue a career in FOSS organizations.
3. Map the students to good mentors so they can start working towards a particular career goal.
4. Promote the various aspects of an engineer apart from coding.

To achieve these goals, the society plans to build on the strong foundation of Open Source culture, and work with the ethics and dynamics of the aforementioned.

In the spirit of Open Source culture, the OpenCode-MAIT has completely omitted any kind of membership  system- paid or free. To make sure a healthy and engaging 
community thrives,  they plan to take sessions on open source technologies, monthly Devsprints where attendees can actually work with those technologies on ideas 
they want to realize.

 **OpenCode-MAIT** also aims to have show and tell at regular intervals, where students can promote their projects and tell the community of 
their progress on certain projects. Not only they get recognition on their projects, but they get exposure to public speaking, and access to potential teammates 
for hackathons or professional contacts.

Currently, they plan to organize a short orientation session in the end of March, where students will get to know more about various opportunities in FOSS, and 
how **OpenCode-MAIT** will help them grab those opportunities.
