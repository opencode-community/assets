Hi there, GitHub! <br>
I am Piyush Aggarwal, an engineering student currently pursuing B.Tech from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India. I'm currently in my third year of the degree, and have been familiar with the concept of Free and Open Source Softwares for about the same 3 years now. <br>
I have been vigilant about the current state of our college, and the various currently active societies(IEEE, Google DSC, ACM, CSI) within the college. <br>

As I noticed, there was an alarming lack of awareness regarding Open Source, and the culture revolving around it. I took the initiative and, with help of some good friends, formed a community titled "OpenCode-MAIT" to help spread awareness and promote Free and Open Source Software culture within the college.

Our Team:- <br>
Abhishek Chaudhary: Full stack developer, Google Udacity Nanodegree scholar for Android Development <br>
Piyush Aggarwal: Open source enthusiast, currently working with KDE Connect and in-training for GitHub Campus Experts campaign <br>
Rituka Patwal: A mobile app developer, currently working with KDE Plasma Mobile <br>
Rohan Maity: Google Certified Android Associate Developer <br>
Saurabh Jindal: Cybersecurity enthusiast and bug bounty hunter <br>

The complete documentation of everything- from the community proposal submitted to the HODs of CSE(Computer Science & Engineering) and IT(Information Technology) Department, to the MoMs(Minutes of Meetings) from every meeting held, have been uploaded to the GitHub organization repositories, and they were all made using free and open source software like VS Code and its supporting extensions. <br>

We also hosted a staic website using GitHub Pages: https://opencode-mait.github.io <br>
We tweet about our every session and event at: https://twitter.com/OpenCodeMAIT <br>
The infrastructure of our college community was inspired by ILUG-D(India Linux Users Group-Delhi). https://github.com/ilugd <br>
We have used the features provided by GitHub like GitHub Pages, and hosted our entire documentation on GitHub, to keep the spirit of Open Source culture alive and prospering within our community, and we aim to keep at it!

Sadly, as with every Free and Open Source community, we need funds for any competitions or prizes for most contributions in devsprints. With a small team of just 5 members, it becomes hard for us to promote Open Source culture with full force, and without enough motivation(in terms of swags), new faces tend to return to their normal routines rather than learning new skills and returning to consequent sessions to know a wider world full of programmers and developers.

For the above stated reasons, I write this mail with a humble request. Kindly send us some stickers and pamphlets to distribute in our college sessions. <br>
Also, please allow us some funds to spread more awareness about our community within the college with posters and pamphlets.

Best Regards <br>
Piyush Aggarwal <br>
