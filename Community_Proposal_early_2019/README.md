# OpenCode

The Free & Open Source Software Community of MAIT

__

### Overview

The volunteer-driven community aims to spread awareness about the various open source softwares and the culture revolving around open source.

### Goals

1. Promote the use of Open Source software in our college.
2. Invite prominent speakers expert in their particular domain, to encourage students to pursue a career in FOSS organizations.
3. Map the students to good mentors so they can start working towards a particular career goal.
4. Promote the various aspects of an engineer apart from coding.
   
### Specifications

In the spirit of Open Source culture, we do not plan a membership system. Responsible students identified by the existing volunteers collectively, may be included in the volunteers list and organizing committee after deciding with the static members of the community.
To make sure a healthy and engaging community, we plan to take sessions on open source technologies, monthly DevSprints where attendees can actually work with those technologies on projects. We also aim to have a show and tell at regular intervals, where students can promote their projects and tell the community of their progress on certain projects.

#### Hierarchy

The only static area of the community is an organizing team, along with the students taking the sessions for the technologies. As a volunteer driven community, we aim to keep a minimal amount of pressure on our fellows. Interested students may step up for tasks like drafting a poster, TA duty, drafting mails for mailing list.

#### Sessions
We hope to achieve our goals by organizing regular sessions on specific technologies, namely - CyberSecurity, Kotlin, Flutter, Django and Open Source practices.

We propose to have one session (60 minutes at maximum) on each of these topics in every week, after college hours (4:45 pm - 5:45 pm).

#### Finance

In the light of the fact that we aim to promote Free & Open Source culture, we have decided to keep the community as a non-profit initiative. Voluntary donations by any organization or student may be gladly accepted.

#### Sustainability

In the long run, we will find volunteers that maintain the momentum by imparting their knowledge to the attendees in the coming years.
Alumni and contacts pursuing a career in open source may also be invited to talk about the things in Open Source they love, to encourage students about the same.

#### Requirements

We request the college to kindly allow us access to a lab after college hours, where internet is accessible to the attendees.
Also, we need a projector to present slides to the attendees of the sessions.

Lastly, we request the college to kindly allow us nominal fundings for any promotional materials made-to-order for special talks or sessions, for eg: posters, prizes.

### Tentative Milestones

1. #### Contributions to open source projects by attendees

    Monthly DevSprints can be a good place where attendees are mentored on specific open source projects so they can resolve any issues in the software itself.
    Along with the experience of working remotely, they will also be able to learn about the inner workings of the softwares they use on various projects.

2. #### Personal projects made with Open Source technologies 
    
    Students after learning about open source technologies can make good projects with the guidance of their mentors.
